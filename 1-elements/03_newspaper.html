   <h1>For The First Time, Tests With Gene Therapy Begin</h1>
   <h4>Jan. 30, 1991</h4>
   <p>Two cancer patients yesterday became the first people to receive<br>
      gene therapy in an attempt to defeat otherwise incurable tumors.</p>
   <p>In a simple procedure that lasted barely 20 minutes, the patients, a<br>
      29-year-old woman and a 42-year-old man, were each infused with<br> 
      about 100 million white blood cells. The cells enfolded a genetically<br>
      engineered copy of a gene that makes a potent anti-cancer enzyme.</p>
